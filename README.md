just some notes

I was not entirely sure what all the functionality should be of this shopping and or if you 
would like to see it in a framework such as Laravel, based on the discussion we had thus far I made the assumption 
that it will be better to do this in plain php. I hope this is acceptable.

I added git commits as frequently as possible to show progress
But basically started with the db layout.

Once we have the DB in place, I believe it is good start to from the bottom up
thus creating the db connections and making sure this is working correctly.

The order off business is as follows
 - new list
 - add an item to the list
 - view the list
 - mark an item on the list being viewed
 - remove items from the list
 - edit item name
