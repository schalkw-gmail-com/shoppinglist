just some notes

I was not entirely sure what all the functionality (bells and whistle) should be of this shopping lits and or if you 
would like to see it in a framework such as Laravel, based on the discussion we had thus far I made the assumption 
that it will be better to do this in plain php. I hope this is acceptable. As a back end developer my process allows starts 
with the database and then i build it out from there.

I added git commits as frequently as possible to show progress.

The order in which i created the back end functionality is as follows
 - new list
 - add an item to the list
 - view the list
 - mark an item on the list 
 - remove items from the list
 - edit a item name

Once the back end is running, I can start cleaning up the code
