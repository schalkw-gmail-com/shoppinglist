just some notes:

I was not entirely sure what all the functionality (bells and whistle) should be of this shopping lists and or if you 
would like to see it in a framework such as Laravel, based on the discussion we had thus far I made the assumption 
that it will be better to do this in plain php. I hope this is acceptable. As a back end developer my process allows starts 
with the database, and then I build it out from there.

Please note that in the light of time constraints, I decided not go a for a OOP setup on this. That is also why 
i have not done any testing etc.

I added git commits as frequently as possible to show progress.

The order in which i created the back end functionality is as follows
 - new list
 - add an item to the list
 - view the list
 - mark an item on the list 
 - remove items from the list
 - edit a item name

Once the back end is running, I can start cleaning up the code and making the front look a bit prettier. Seeing that 
i'm a back end developer, I will give this a shot, but I can not promise an oil painting. 

After I have done some clean up and made things a little more pretty, I realised I did not have an example of joining tables
with SQL, therefor I added a new button as a view mode for the particular list.
